# Sensex-100DMA-Strategy

## Intro 📝

A study conducted to get an idea on how simple moving average based entry-exit strategy compared with buy and hold strategy on BSE Sensex.

A simple moving average based Entry-Exit Strategy:
1. To exit the sensex every time it crosses below a pre-determined moving threshold
2. Re-Enter only when the sensex crosses above the threshold.
3. Time period is considered from 1 September 2003 (the time when BSE followed free float market cap).

## The Findings 🤯

_</ these result are considered only by price movement and not by any other factors />_

### Entry-Exit Based Strategy:
1. Perform best in predicting the drawdowns and move to cash
2. Lags in giving extra-ordinary uptrend when compared with buy and hold


### Buy and Hold:
1. Beat Entry-Exit based strategy but not with huge margin
2. Follows a complete cycle of drawdowns (as it does not move to cash)

### Alternatives 😇
1. Entry-Exit strategy best outperforms when we take 75 DMA.
